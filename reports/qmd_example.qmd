# Aim
This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada between 1906 and 1972 for each province.

# Data
Horse population data were sourced from the [Government of Canada's Open Data website](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) [@horses1; @horses2].

# Methods
The analysis was conducted using Python [@Python] and the following libraries:
- pandas [@pandas]
- altair [@altair]
- click [@click]
- Quarto [@Allaire_Quarto_2022]

*Note: This report is adapted from Timbers (2020) [@ttimbers-horses].*

# Results

## Horse Population Trends

::: {#fig-horse-pop}

:::

**Figure @fig-horse-pop**: Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972.

As seen in **Figure @fig-horse-pop**, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada. All provinces have experienced a decline in horse populations since 1940, likely due to the rise of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and World War II.

## Standard Deviation of Horse Populations

The standard deviation values for each province are listed in **Table @tbl-horses-sd**.

::: {#tbl-horses-sd}
```{python}
import pandas as pd
horses_sd_table = pd.read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
horses_sd_table
```
:::

**Table @tbl-horses-sd**: Standard deviation of historical horse populations (1906-1972) for each Canadian province.

The province with the highest standard deviation in horse population is:

```{python}
largest_sd = horses_sd_table.iloc[0, 0]
f"The province with the largest standard deviation is **{largest_sd}**."
```

## Province with Largest Standard Deviation

::: {#fig-largest-sd}

:::

**Figure @fig-largest-sd**: Horse populations for **{largest_sd}**, the province with the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
